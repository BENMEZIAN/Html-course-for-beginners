        <p>At this session, we will be seeing the head section and its tags and their attributes</p>

        <p>title : The title element represents the document's title or name. Authors should use titles 
            that identify their documents even when they are used out of context, for example in a user's 
            history or bookmarks, or in search results. The document's title is often different 
            from its first heading, since the first heading does not have to stand alone when taken out of 
            context.
        </p>
